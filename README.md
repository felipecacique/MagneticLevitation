Magnetic Levitation Using Arduino: An
 In-Depth Technical Review
 September 16, 2024
 1 Introduction
 Magnetic levitation technology enables objects to float by balancing magnetic
 forces and gravitational pull. The project focuses on constructing a magnetic
 levitation system using an Arduino, emphasizing control through sensors and
 precise electromagnetic fields. This system successfully levitated a magnet verti
cally using a solenoid coil, Hall-effect sensors, and a PID (Proportional-Integral
Derivative) controller.
 2 System Overview
 The primary objective was to develop a closed-loop control system that levitates
 a magnet by manipulating the electromagnetic force generated by a solenoid coil.
 The system consists of:
 • Solenoid Coil: Generates the magnetic field to attract the magnet.
 • Hall-Effect Sensors: Measure the magnetic field strength to provide
 feedback on the magnet’s position.
 • Arduino Microcontroller: Processes the sensor data and adjusts the
 coil’s current accordingly.
 • PID Control Algorithm: Ensures stable levitation by dynamically ad
justing the control signal.
 3 General System Analysis
 The proposed magnetic levitation system is composed of an electromagnet
 placed above the levitating object. The electromagnet generates a magnetic
 f
 ield that is controlled by the current flowing from the Arduino. The magnetic
 f
 ield produces a vertical magnetic force on the object that acts in the opposite
 1
direction to its weight. The goal is to balance these forces so that the object
 remains suspended in the air.
 AHall-effect sensor detects the position of the levitating object by measuring
 the magnetic field generated by both the magnet and the coil. The sensor
 outputs an electrical signal corresponding to the object’s position. This signal
 is fed into the controller, which then adjusts the magnetic field strength in real
time to ensure the object remains stable at the desired reference position. The
 feedback control loop continuously adjusts the current to maintain the object’s
 position.
 A control system block diagram is used to represent how the components
 interact with each other:
 • The electromagnet generates the magnetic field.
 • The Hall-effect sensor detects the position of the object by measuring the
 magnetic field.
 • The sensor’s signal is sent to the Arduino (controller).
 • TheArduino adjusts the current in the coil based on the position feedback,
 controlling the magnetic field to maintain stable levitation.
 The system dynamically balances the forces acting on the object, which
 requires precise real-time control. The PID controller plays a crucial role in
 minimizing the error between the desired and actual positions of the levitating
 object. The control loop ensures that any disturbance in the object’s position is
 corrected quickly by adjusting the magnetic field generated by the electromag
net.
 4 Physics and Electromagnetism
 The foundation of this project relies on electromagnetic theory, particularly
 the interaction between a solenoid’s magnetic field and a ferromagnetic object
 (the magnet).
 4.1 Magnetic Field of a Solenoid
 The solenoid generates a magnetic field when current flows through its windings.
 The magnetic field (B) inside a solenoid is given by:
 B =µ0· N ·I
 L
 Where:
 • B is the magnetic flux density (measured in Tesla),
 • µ0 is the permeability of free space (4π × 10−7T· m/A),
 2
 (1)
• N is the number of turns of the coil,
 • I is the current through the coil (in amperes),
 • Lis the length of the solenoid.
 The force exerted on the magnet is directly related to this magnetic field
 and opposes gravity. This balancing act ensures levitation:
 Fm =B·µm
 Where µm is the magnetic moment of the object.
 4.2 Levitation Equilibrium
 (2)
 The system must balance the upward magnetic force (Fm) with the downward
 gravitational force (Fg):
 Fm =Fg =m·g
 (3)
 Where m is the mass of the levitating object and g is the gravitational accel
eration. However, maintaining stable levitation requires continuously adjusting
 B based on the magnet’s position, which is done through feedback control.
 5 Sensor Calibration and Placement
 The levitation system used two Hall-effect sensors, one placed above the solenoid
 and the other below, to measure the magnetic field changes as the magnet
 moved.
 5.1 Hall-Effect Sensors
 These sensors detect the magnetic field by converting it into a proportional
 voltage. A Hall-effect sensor’s output voltage (VH) is described by:
 VH =KH·B+V0
 Where:
 • KH is the sensitivity of the sensor (in volts per Tesla),
 • B is the magnetic flux density at the sensor’s position,
 (4)
 • V0 is the output when no field is present (typically 2.5V for 5V-supplied
 sensors).
 By placing one sensor above and one below the levitating magnet, the
 system can detect the difference between the field created by the solenoid and
 the field created by the magnet. This configuration allows the system to isolate
 the magnet’s contribution, critical for accurate position sensing.

The output from each sensor:
 S1 =Bmagnet +Bsolenoid, S2 = Bsolenoid
 Taking the difference:
 S1 −S2 =Bmagnet
 (5)
 (6)
 This eliminates the solenoid’s field from the measurement, leaving only the
 magnet’s field for position feedback.
 5.2 Sensor Output to Distance Conversion
 The output voltage of the Hall-effect sensor can be converted into a correspond
ing distance using a mathematical model derived from the calibration data. The
 non-linear relationship between voltage and distance was approximated by the
 following exponential equation:
 Z =a+b·e−VH
 c +d·e−VH
 e
 Where:
 • Z is the distance from the magnet to the sensor (in cm),
 • VH is the voltage output from the Hall-effect sensor (in Volts),
 • a,b,c,d,e are constants determined through the calibration process.
 ## 6. Circuit Design

The electrical system consisted of several key components to drive the solenoid and process sensor signals.

### 6.1 Current Amplification

The Arduino alone cannot supply enough current to the solenoid to produce the necessary magnetic field. A TIP112 Darlington transistor was used to amplify the control signal from the Arduino. The transistor operates in two states: cutoff (no current through the solenoid) and saturation (maximum current through the solenoid).

The transistor’s base current controls the output current through the solenoid, where:

\[ I_c = \beta \cdot I_b \]

With a high current gain (\(\beta \approx 1000\)), the transistor ensures that small adjustments from the Arduino result in significant changes in the solenoid’s current.

### 6.2 Difference Between Sensors and Amplifier

The difference between the two Hall-effect sensor outputs was calculated using an electronic circuit. Specifically, an operational amplifier (op-amp) in a differential configuration was employed to subtract the output of the bottom sensor (S2) from the top sensor (S1). This method electronically isolates the magnetic field (\(B_{solenoid}\)) generated by the magnet from the field of the solenoid.

The output voltage was fed into an operational amplifier circuit. This amplified the small voltage differences between the sensors, making the system more sensitive to minor positional changes. The amplified output was then fed to the Arduino’s analog input for processing.

## 7. Control Theory: The PID Algorithm

The core of the system’s stability lies in the PID controller, which dynamically adjusts the solenoid’s current based on the magnet’s position error.

### 7.1 PID Control Equation

The PID controller adjusts the output by summing three terms:

\[ u(t) = K_p \cdot e(t) + K_i \int_{0}^{t} e(\tau) d\tau + K_d \frac{d}{dt} e(t) \]

Where:
- **u(t)** is the control signal (PWM value),
- **e(t)** is the error (difference between desired and actual position),
- **K_p** is the proportional gain,
- **K_i** is the integral gain,
- **K_d** is the derivative gain.

### 7.2 Code Implementation

The Arduino code implemented the PID control by reading the sensors, computing the error, and adjusting the PWM signal accordingly. Here’s a simplified version of the key code:

```cpp
double Kp = 2.0, Ki = 0.5, Kd = 1.0;
double setPoint = 0.0; // Desired magnet position
double input, output;
double lastInput, I, error;

void loop() {
    input = readSensor(); // Get sensor data
    error = setPoint - input;
    
    // Proportional term
    double P = Kp * error;
    
    // Integral term
    I += (Ki * error);
    
    // Derivative term
    double D = Kd * (input - lastInput);
    
    // Compute the PID output
    output = P + I - D;
    
    // Apply the output to the solenoid (PWM)
    analogWrite(SOLENOID_PIN, output);
    
    // Update last input for next iteration
    lastInput = input;
}
This code continuously monitors the magnet’s position, calculates the PID
 values, and adjusts the solenoid’s current via PWM.
 ## 8 System Calibration
 To optimize the system’s performance, the sensors were calibrated, and the
 PID constants were fine-tuned experimentally. Calibration involved measuring
 the sensor outputs at known positions and adjusting the gains (Kp,Ki,Kd) for
 stable levitation.
 The calibration also involved characterizing the system’s dynamic response,
 ensuring the magnet would not oscillate excessively. The proportional gain
 was adjusted to react quickly, while the derivative gain was tuned to minimize
 overshooting.
 ## 9 Conclusion
 The magnetic levitation system successfully demonstrated stable levitation us
ing electromagnetic control. The integration of Hall-effect sensors, feedback
 control, and a well-tuned PID algorithm allowed for precise vertical position
 regulation. Despite the system’s non-linear nature, the use of two sensors and
 a differential measurement strategy provided accurate feedback. The project’s
 outcome met the initial goals of levitating a magnet with a small, controllable
 range of motion.
